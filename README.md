Dark Mode Toggle Button
The dark mode toggle button is located at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
The button will display a sun icon when the application is in dark mode and a moon icon when in light mode.
The button smoothly transitions between the two icons and positions itself based on the screen size, thanks to responsive media queries.
